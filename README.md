University of Auckland Computer Science assignments re-written in Rust for my own pleasure and at my own leisure. I understand that assignments are very likely protected and the property of the University therefore I will not release my actual assignment submissions nor will I release the assignment handouts / briefs in the case that this gives any other student an pre-release advantage.
